4.21.00

At Jay's suggestion, added activeTimeRanges.minutes column to gam print cros/crosactivity.
activeTimeRanges.activeTime: milliseconds
activeTimeRanges.duration: hh:mm:ss
activeTimeRanges.minutes: minutes

4.20.05

Added start <Date> and end <Date> arguments to gam info cros and gam print cros to allow filtering of activeTimeRanges.
These arguments have no effect unless the activetimeranges|timeranges field name is specified.
If start <Date> is not specifed, then there is no filtering for starting date.
If end <Date> is not specifed, then there is no filtering for ending date.
    gam info cros <CrOSItem> [nolists] [listlimit <Number>] [start <Date>] [end <Date>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]

    gam print cros [todrive [<ToDriveAttributes>]] [query <QueryCrOS>]
	[orderby <CrOSOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [nolists] [listlimit <Number>] [start <Date>] [end <Date>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]

Based on code by Jay, added a command to get CrOS device activity.
    gam print crosactivity [todrive [<ToDriveAttributes>]] [query <QueryCrOS>]
	[recentusers] [timeranges] [both] [listlimit <Number>] [start <Date>] [end <Date>] [delimiter <String>] 

The basic column headers are: deviceId,annotatedAssetId,annotatedLocation,serialNumber,orgUnitPath.
If recentusers is specified, all of the recent users email addresses, separated by the delimiter <String>,
are put on a separate row, with header recentUsers.email, in addition to the basic headers.
If timeranges is specified, each pair of time range values, activeTimeRanges.date and activeTimeRanges.duration,
are put on a separate row with the basic headers.
The default is to include both recentusers and timeranges.
The listlimit <Number> argument limits the number of recent users and time ranges to <Number>. If <Number> equals zero, there is no limit.
The start <Date> and end <Date> arguments filter the time ranges.

Example: gam print crosactivity recentusers start 2017-03-01 end 2017-03-31 listlimit 10 delimiter " "
For each CrOS device, thus will yield a space delimited list of the 10 most recent users for the month of March.

4.20.04

Fix bug in adding ACL to calendar.

4.20.03

When todrive is specified and nobrowser.txt is present, the email regarding the upload will be sent to the
email address specified with the tduser command line argument. If the tduser argument is not specified,
the email is sent to the G Suite administrator. Previously, the email was always sent to the G Suite administrator.

4.20.02

Use service account for uploading todrive reports and sending email messages when no_browser is true.

4.20.01

Fix gam <UserTypeEntity> add smime, original code from Jay was not correct.

4.20.00

Courtesy of Jay, added basic TeamDrive support.
    <TeamDriveID> ::= <String>
    gam <UserTypeEntity> add teamdrive <Name>
    gam <UserTypeEntity> update teamdrive <TeamDriveID> [name <Name>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete teamdrive <TeamDriveID>
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show teamdrives
    gam <UserTypeEntity> print teamdrives [todrive]

4.13.02

Handle corrupt files in gamcache by turning caching off for the current command.
Handle additional errors from oauthclient/client.py.
Clean up exception handling.

4.13.01

Added nocache argument to gam get drivefile to prevent the Google API from caching a file download. Due to a flaw in a Python library,
caching the download of certain files throws an exception preventing the file from being downloaded.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile (id <DriveFileID>)|(drivefilename <DriveFileName>)|(query <QueryDriveFile>) [format <FileFormatList>] [targetfolder <FilePath>] [revision <Number>] [nocache]

4.13.00

Added Reseller API support, derived from Jay's initial code.
    <ResoldCustomerAttributes> ::=
	(email|alternateemail <EmailAddress>)|
	(contact|contactname <String>)|
	(phone|phonenumber <String>)|
	(name|organizationname <String>)|
	(address|address1|addressline1 <String>)|
	(address2|addressline2 <String>)|
	(address3|addressline3 <String>)|
	(city|locality <String>)|
	(state|region <String>)|
	(zipcode|postal|postalcode <String>)|
	(country|countrycode <String>)

    gam create resoldcustomer <CustomerDomain> (customer_auth_token <String>) <ResoldCustomerAttributes>+
    gam update resoldcustomer <CustomerID> [customer_auth_token <String>] <ResoldCustomerAttribues>+
    gam info resoldcustomer <CustomerID>

    gam create resoldsubscription <CustomerID> (sku <SKUID>)
	 (plan annual_monthly_pay|annual_yearly_pay|flexible|trial) (seats <NumberOfSeats> <MaximumNumberOfSeats>)
	 [customer_auth_token <String>] [deal <String>] [purchaseorderid <String>]
    gam update resoldsubscription <CustomerID> <SKUID>
	activate|suspend|startpaidservice|
	(renewal auto_renew_monthly_pay|auto_renew_yearly_pay|cancel|renew_current_users_monthly_pay|renew_current_users_yearly_pay|switch_to_pay_as_you_go)|
	(seats <NumberOfSeats> [<MaximumNumberOfSeats>])|
	(plan annual_monthly_pay|annual_yearly_pay|flexible|trial [deal <String>] [purchaseorderid <String>] [seats <NumberOfSeats> [<MaximumNumberOfSeats>]])
    gam delete resoldsubscription <CustomerID> <SKUID> cancel|downgrade|transfer_to_direct
    gam info resoldsubscription <CustomerID>  <SKUID>
    gam show resoldsubscriptions [customerid <CustomerID>] [customer_auth_token <String>] [customer_prefix <String>]
    gam print resoldsubscriptions [todrive [<ToDriveAttributes>]] [customerid <CustomerID>] [customer_auth_token <String>] [customer_prefix <String>]

4.12.06

Implement allcache.txt signal file so that caching can be more finely controlled.
If nocache.txt is present, no GAM API calls are cached.
If allcache.txt is present and nocache.txt is not present, all GAM API calls are cached.
If neither file is present, only GAM discovery API calls are cached.
The last combination caches GAM discovery API calls that usually return the same value
without consuming large amounts of disc space as when all GAM API calls are cached.

4.12.05

Fixed gam print users to include primaryEmail field when custom argument is specified.

gam print users [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [query <QueryUser>] [deleted_only|only_deleted])
        [groups] [license|licenses|licence|licences] [emailpart|emailparts|username]
        [orderby <UserOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [userview]
        [allfields|basic|full | ((<UserFieldName>* | fields <UserFieldNameList>) [schemas|custom all|<SchemaNameList>])]

There are basically three printing modes, choose one:
Everything except custom fields (these two options are identical): allfields|basic
Everything including all custom fields: full
Selected fields: ((<UserFieldName>* | fields <UserFieldNameList>) [schemas|custom all|<SchemaNameList>])
You can specify fields by entering the individual fields separately or by specifying a list of fields, the following items are equivalent:
primaryemail id name 
fields "primaryemail,id,name"
When selecting fields, you can specify that you want all custom fields or selected custom fields.
All custom fields: custom all
Selected custom fields: custom <SchemaNameList>

4.12.04

When todrive tdparent id:<DriveFolderID>|<DriveFolderName> is specified, in addition to checking that the parent is an existing folder, the folder is verified as being writable.

Removed limit on number of scopes that can be authorized in gam oauth create. If the number of scopes selected is large, the authorization URL
can not be shortened and a very long URL is displayed but the authorization still works.

Added Admin Settings API support, this allows gam info customer/instance to show license count information.

4.12.03

Anywhere you can specify todrive, there are additional subarguments following the todrive argument that let you title the file,
direct the uploaded file to a particular user and location and add a timestamp to the file title.
    <ToDriveAttributes> ::=
	(tdtitle <String>)|(tduser <EmailAddress>)|(tdparent id:<DriveFolderID>|<DriveFolderName>)|(tdtimestamp <Boolean> [tddaysoffset <Number>] [tdhoursoffset <Number])
The tdtitle argument specifies the title for the uploaded file, if not specified, the Gam default title is used.
The tduser argument specifies the user to receive the uploaded file; if not specified, the user named in oauth2.txt receives the file.
The tdparent argument specifies an existing/writable parent folder for the uploaded file; if not specified, the root folder is used.
The tdtimestamp argument specifies whether a timestamp (of the time the file is uploaded to Google) will be added to the title of the uploaded file.
The tddaysoffset and tdhoursoffset arguments let you specify values that subtract time from the timestamp, they default to 0.
A possible use for these values is as documentation to reflect the end of the time period that the uploaded report covers.
Example: generate a list of user IDs and names, title the file "User IDs and Names", upload it to the "GAM Reports" folder of usermgr@domain.com, add a timestamp to the title.
    gam print users todrive tdtitle "User IDs and Names" tduser usermgr@domain.com tdparent "GAM Reports" tdtimestamp true id name

Note!! The tdparent option requires a scope that Gam currently doesn't authorize; you must do the following commands once to enable the scope.
gam oauth delete
gam oauth create

4.12.02

Optimize license processing.

4.12.01

Handle unbalanced quotes errors in gam batch.
If errors are encountered a batch file, none of the commands will be executed.

4.12.00

Fix control-C handling in gam batch/csv.

The elements of a <ProductIDList> or <SKUIDList> must be separated by commas not spaces; this applies to gam print licenses, gam info user, gam print users
and gam licenses <SKUIDLIst> <Command> ...

Added LicensesDisplay column to CSV file for gam print users licenses to show descriptive name of license SKU.
The Licenses column still displays the actual SKU.

4.11.12

Add product <ProductID> argument to license commands to allow for future changes by Google.
Improve license handling courtesy of Jay.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> add license <SKUID> [product|productid <ProductID>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> update license <SKUID> [product|productid <ProductID>] [from] <SKUID>
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete license <SKUID> [product|productid <ProductID>]

4.11.07

G Suite Enterprise SKU changed from Google-Apps-Enterprise to 1010020020.

4.11.06

Sort columns in gam report users.

Added support for reporting user's two step verification status.
Added S/MIME support thanks to Jay.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> add smime file <FileName> [password <Password>] [sendas|sendasemail <EmailAddress>] [default]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> update smime [id <SmimeID>] [sendas|sendasemail <EmailAddress>] [default]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete smime [id <SmimeID>] [sendas|sendasemail <EmailAddress>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show smime [primaryonly]

4.03.25

Update http2lib/cacerts.txt

4.03.34

Apply Jay's fix to correct gam create project problem.

4.03.33

When specifiying multivalued schema field values, empty values can be suppressed by using the multinonempty option.
This is most useful when updating users from a CSV file where users have different numbers of values for a multivalued schema field.
    <SchemaName>.<FieldName> [multivalued|multivalue|value|multinonempty [type work|home|other|(custom <String>)]] <String>)

4.03.32

Handle group member of type customer when processing groups.

4.03.31

Added skipfields <CourseFieldNameList> argument to gam print courses to allow deselection of specific fields to print.
    gam print courses [todrive] [teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [alias|aliases] [delimiter <String>]
        [show all|students|teachers] [fields <CourseFieldNameList>] [skipfields <CourseFieldNameList>]

4.03.30

group <GroupName> should only return users except when updating groups. Previously, group <GroupName> returned
all members (users and groups) which would cause errors when executing commands like: gam group <GroupName> ...
Previously, this command would print all group members: gam group <GroupName> print
Now, it will only print the users; use this command to get the list of member (user and group) email addresses:  gam print group-members group <GroupName> email

Handle enable API error in gam create project.

4.03.29

Allow newlines in calendar event descriptions.

4.03.28

Date change in 4.03.27 was off by one day, corrected.

4.03.27

Update gam report admin|calendars|drive|groups|logins|mobile|tokens to print start_time and end_time parameters as dates rather than big integers.

4.03.26

Added fields <CourseFieldNameList> argument to gam print courses to allow selection of specific fields.

<CourseFieldName> ::=
	alternatelink|
	coursegroupemail|
	coursematerialsets|
	coursestate|
	creationtime|
	description|
	descriptionheading|
	enrollmentcode|
	guardiansenabled|
	id|
	name|
	ownerid|
	room|
	section|
	teacherfolder|
	teachergroupemail|
	updatetime
<CourseFieldNameList> ::= "<CourseFieldName>(,<CourseFieldName>)*"

gam print courses [todrive] [teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [alias|aliases] [delimiter <String>] [show all|students|teachers] [fields <CourseFieldNameList>]

4.03.25

Fixed gam transfer drive to move orphaned files of the source user to the proper folder of the target user.

4.03.24

Added shownoneditable argument to gam print aliases; this will show noneditable aliases in a column labelled NonEditableAlias.

4.03.23

Changed gam print groups output when any of members/memberscount/managers/managerscount/owners/ownerscount are specified.
When members/managers/owners are specified, there will be two columns per role: Members,MembersCount,Managers,ManagersCount,Owners,OwnersCount
When memberscount/managerscount/ownerscount are specified, there will be one column per role: MembersCount,ManagersCount,OwnersCount

4.03.22

Added memberscount, managerscount and ownerscount arguments to gam print groups; they cause the number of members/managers/owners to be shown,
not the list of email addresses.
Added allfields argument to gam print groups; this selects all of the basic group settings and all of the extended groups settings.
Added directmemberscount to <GroupFieldName>; if this field is specified in gam print groups, it shows the number of entries in a group.
    gam print groups [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [member <UserItem>])
	[maxresults <Number>] [allfields|([settings] <GroupFieldName>* [fields <GroupFieldNameList>])] [delimiter <String>]
	[members|memberscount] [managers|managerscount] [owners|ownerscount]

4.03.21

Handle suspended/no-calendar-access user in calendar commands.

4.03.20

Use patch API rather than update API for gam update customer.

4.03.19

Handle unknown users in print datatransfers.

4.03.18

Use update instead of patch in gam update user to get around Google bug.

4.03.17

Added show all|students|teachers argument to gam print courses. This allows you to get course and participant information in the same CSV file.
The default is to not get participant information.
    gam print courses [todrive] [teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [alias|aliases] [delimiter <String>] [show all|students|teachers]

Added show all|students|teachers argument to gam print course-participants to select what members to display; the default is all.
    gam print course-participants [todrive] (course|class <CourseID>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>]) [show all|students|teachers]

4.03.16

Give better information on usage error.
Define Google Product SKU Google-Apps-For-Government (gafg)

4.03.15

Fixed error in run_batch.

4.03.14

Switched back to multi-processing.

4.03.12

Minor cleanup.

4.03.11

Thanks to Jay, multithreading was changed to multiprocessing for gam batch and gam csv; this should increase performance.

Gam variables can now be set on the command line, see GamCommands.txt for detaile.

4.03.10

Fix gam delete/get drivefile to handle Drive folder alternateLinks.

4.03.09

Improvements to handling Google misreporting invalid group in gam print groups settings.

4.03.08

The Email Settings API, used by versions of Gam prior to 3.7, would automatically create a label if a you added a filter that specified a label that didn't exist.
The Gmail API, used by versions of Gam from 3.7 on, does not automatically create the label, thus, you don't get the expected result.
This version of Gam creates the label for you to give the expected result.

4.03.07

Reference gam create project and gam check serviceaccount rather than https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki/CreatingClientSecretsFile.
Handle Google misreporting invalid group in gam print groups settings.

4.03.06

Do not get/set settings for special groups abuse and postmaster.

4.03.05

Improve gam print groups settings performance.

4.03.04

Strip carriage returns from signature and vacation message.

4.03.03

Added html argument to gam add sendas/update sendas/signature to control newline (NL) processing when signature is read from a file.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> [add] sendas <EmailAddress> <Name> [signature|sig <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*] [html] [replyto <EmailAddress>] [default] [treatasalias <Boolean>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> update sendas <EmailAddress> [name <Name>] [signature|sig <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*] [html] [replyto <EmailAddress>] [default] [treatasalias <Boolean>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> signature|sig <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)* [html] [name <String>] [replyto <EmailAddress>] [default] [treatasalias <Boolean>]
When html is not specified, newlines are converted to <br/>; this allows simple, multi-line files to be interpreted properly by Google.
When html is specified, newlines are not converted to <br/>; this allows multi-line HTML files to be interpreted properly by Google, no extra blank lines will be included.

4.03.02

Improve Unicode handling when reading files.

4.03.01

Thanks to Jay for the following.
Added gam create project command which is used to create Client and Service Account IDs.
    gam create project [<EmailAddress>]

4.03.00
Minor fixes by Jay and Ross. Mostly to new install process.

4.02.00

Thanks to Jay for the following.
Added command to delete calendar events by ID or query from a single calendar.
    gam calendar <CalendarItem> deleteevent (id|eventid <EventID>)* (q|query|eventquery <QueryCalendar>)* [doit] [notifyattendees]
The id argument may be repeated to specify multiple IDs.
A calendar query is a free text search of all of the words in <QueryCalendar>, it is an "and" query. To perform an "or" query,
enter multiple query arguments.
Example, delete all events with "Bob" and "Carol" or "Ted and Alice" in them.
    gam calendar testcal delete event query "Bob Carol" query "Ted Alice" doit
The doit argument is required to actually perform the deletions.

Added support for queries in gam info cros as in gam update cros.
    <CrOSItem> ::= <CrOSID>|(query:<QueryCrOS>)
    gam info cros <CrOSItem> [nolists] [listlimit <Number>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]

Added support for newline characters in the unstructured field of a users address.
$ gam update user testuser address type home unstructured "123 Main Street\nAnytown, CA 12345\nUSA" primary
updating user testuser@domain.com...
$ gam info user testuser nogroups nolicenses

 primary: True

Added optional <EmailAddress> to gam oauth create; if not specified, you will be prompted to enter an email address.
This email address will be used to direct your browser to login at accounts.google.com with the specified address for scope authorization.
The intent is to help prevent using some other currently open session in your browser from doing the scope authorization.
    gam oauth|oauth2 create|request [<EmailAddress>]

Added command to verify Service Account scope authorization. For each Service Account used by GAM, a test is performed to verify that the
scope is authorized. Typically, this command would be executed for a single user.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> check serviceaccount

$ gam user testuser check serviceaccount
User: testuser@domain.com
 Scope: https://mail.google.com/                                     PASS

GAM 3.80.01

Added simple argument to gam version for use by scripts.
      gam version [check] [simple]

GAM 3.80.00
Old GData APIs removed from GAM. Admin Settings and Email Audit commands are no longer included, see GAM-N or GAMADV-X if you use them. All Email Settings commands now use new Gmail API.
Updated httplib2, google-api-client, uritemplate libraries
New update check code utilizes GitHub API to check for latest releases.

GAM 3.73.03

Fixed gam print tokens to show clientId.

GAM 3.73.02

Handle newlines in CrOS notes field.

GAM 3.73.01

Cleaned up processing of guardian invitation cancellations.

GAM 3.73.00

Note!!! Functionality change.
Changed command gam show filetree to show only files owned by the user by default; this makes it consistent with gam show filelist.
To get the prior behavior, add the anyowner argument.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [anyowner] [select <DriveFileEntity>] (orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending])*

Added invitations argument to gam delete guardian so that only a pending invitation for a guardian is cancelled.
    gam delete guardian|guardians <GuardianItem> <StudentItem> [invitations]

Added a command to cancel guardian invitations by invitation ID.
    gam cancel guardianinvitation|guardianinvitations <GuardianInvitationID> <StudentItem>

Added arguments to gam update user to enable clearing entire schemas or schema fields.
    gam update user <UserItem> <UserAttributes>+ [clearschema <SchemaName>] [clearschema <SchemaName>.<FieldName>]

Added support for specifying type in multi-valued schemas. Custom schema fields can be single-valued or multi-valued;
Gam has always supported both but has not supported the type characteristic within a multi-valued schema field.
In gam create/update user, schema fields are now specified as:
    <SchemaName>.<FieldName> [multivalued [type work|home|other|(custom <CustomType>)]] <String>
Examples:
TestSchema.SVField <String> - value is <String>
TestSchema.MVField <String> - type is work (default), value is <String>
TestSchema.MVField type home <String> - type is home, value is <String>
TestSchema.MVField type custom <CustomType> <String> - type is custom, customType is <CustomType>, value is <String>
Compatability note: In the unlikely case that you are currently setting a multi-valued schema field with the value "type",
i.e., TestSchema.MVField type, you will have to change this to TestSchema.MVField type work type.

Added argument to gam print|show filelist to allow specification of output ordering.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> print|show filelist [todrive] [anyowner] [query <QueryDriveFile>] [fullquery <QueryDriveFile>]
	[allfields|<DriveFieldName>*] (orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending])*

Added argument to gam show filetree to allow specification of output ordering.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]*

Credit to Steve Main for suggesting the following enhancement.
Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> signature and gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation to allow pattern substitution in the signature and vacation message.
gam <UserTypeEntity> signature <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*
gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation <TrueValues> subject <String> (message <String>)|(file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*
	[contactsonly] [domainonly] [startdate <Date>] [enddate <Date>]
Every instance of {<Tag>} in the signature/message will be replaced by <String>. Instances of the form {RT}...{Text}...{/RT} will be eliminated
if there was no <Tag> specified that matches Text or if a <Tag> matching Text was specified but the matching <String> is empty.
This is especially useful with CSV files.
gam csv Users.csv gam user "~User" signature file SignatureTemplate.txt replace "#User#" "~User" replace "#Title#" "~Title"

Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature to format the signature.
gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature [format]

Added argument to gam info user to specify SKUs for which license information is desired.
gam info user [<UserItem>] ... [skus <SKUIDList>]

Added argument to gam print printjobs and gam printjob <PrinterID> fetch to allow specifying the maximum number of print jobs to retrieve.

and gam print users produced a listing of primaryEmail addresses. Now, gam print cros produces a listing of deviceIds.
To get the previous behavior, say gam print cros full. See GamCommands.txt for a summary of CrOS and User printing.

Commands that produce CSV file output have been changed to make the leftmost column(s) be the key fields.
If you have scripts that process the CSV files as flat files, expecting the columns to be in a particular
order, they will have to be updated. If your scripts process the CSV files by column header, no changes should be required.

2016/07/31

Added notsuspended argument to gam update group add/sync to prevent adding suspended users to a group
when specifying all users, org <OrgUnitPath> or query <QueryUser> for <UserTypeEntity>.

gam update group <GroupItem> sync [owner|manager|member] [notsuspended] <UserTypeEntity>

Added basic|full argument to gam print mobile to allow specification of output detail desired.
gam print mobile [todrive] [query <QueryMobile>] [basic|full] [orderby <MobileOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]

  -new command: gam all users prism off

GAM 2.992

GAM 2.991
  -gam print commands now support a "todrive" argument. When specified, instead of displaying the CSV output locally (or piping it to a file), GAM will upload the CSV data to a Google Docs Spreadsheet owned by the admin you've authenticated as. The spreadsheet will be opened automatically or, if you've created nobrowser.txt, a URL will be shown.
  -GAM should handle non-English input characters better. Commands like: "gam.py update user rpinaya lastname Piñaya" should work without issue on Windows.
  -Improved errors in various places (less "explosions" more meaningful instructions.
  -gam undelete user is fixed to always use the user's id rather than email address. If an email address is supplied, GAM converts it to a id before attempting to delete. If more than 1 deleted user exists with that address, GAM displays the options.

  -Fixed updating and deleting domain and default users for calendar ACLs
  -proper error handling for adding and removing group members and owners
  -Fixed error on gam info domain caused by failure to retrieve outbound gateway settings.
  -An EXPERIMENTAL 64-bit build of GAM for Windows is now available. I do not expect it will be any bit faster for most GAM commands since most delay
   is due to network I/O. However, some GAM commands like "gam print users", when run against large domains (10,000+ users), use a large amount of memory
   and resources due to result size. In these scenarios, the x64 build MIGHT prove faster. If you try the x64 build, please report how it worked back to 
   the mailing list. "It feels faster" is nice but hard numbers with details of what you did are better :-) Note that if you're using the Python source
   build and your Python is 64-bit, you're already using 64-bit GAM :-)

GAM 2.52
  -It's a dud! Major bug caused me to pull this version 10 minutes after release :-)

GAM 2.51
  -New gam calendar wipe command allows clearing all data off a user's primary calendar

  -Fix issue that broke gam delete resource command
  -GAM now offers to remember your client secret and key when entered the first time
  -various other bug fixes

GAM 2.5
  -GAM now handles and retries errors consistently and provides nice error messages. Long running GAM processes
   like "gam all users" should be much stabler now. Death to the 1000/Unknown errors!
   This involved some major changes to the Google API calls so if you run into problems, try
   downgrading to 2.3.1 and see if they go away. Be sure to submit bug reports!
  -GAM checks for updates 
  -New parameters for gam create user and gam update user
  -New parameters for gam print group: owners, members and settings
  -GAM now works for delegated admins with user read/create/update/delete API rights
  -gam update group add owner now only adds the user as a group owner, not a member (Google Group member
   and owner status are independant of each other)
  -gam update group add member no longer revokes user's owner rights if they have them
  -gam info group now shows owners who are not a member of the group
  -gam now works around the group settings "Backend Error" by making an HTTP request to the groups website.
   This workaround may cease to work if performed on more than a few hundred groups at a time.
  -moving large numbers of users to an Organization is now more reliable and is performed 25 users at a time.
  -gam print users aliases now makes only 1 API call to retrieve all user aliases

  -New user profile photo management commands can update, get and delete user profile photos
  -GAM now gracefully handles cross-domain mailbox delegations by using (or giving the delegate) an alias in the mailbox's domain.
  -"gam user XXXX show delegates" now has optional argument "csv" to print existing delegations in CSV format
  -GAM can now properly rename and delete long usernames by ensuring that the renamed user is max 64 characters in length
  -"gam print groups" now has optional arguments nousermanagedgroups and onlyusermanagedgroups allowing user managed groups to be excluded from output or print user managed groups exclusively.

  -Delete Gmail labels command
  -Fixes for *nix CSV formatting
  -Fixes to make Windows and *nix generated oauth.txt files compatible
  -"gam info user" now shows mailbox quota and user organization
  -"gam update user" can now handle change of user's domain in renames. "gam multi" commands now fully deprecated.
  -Fix reply_to and a few other group settings were never getting updated.
  -"gam info group" now makes 3 efficient API calls rather than one per member/owner of the group greatly increasing performance with large groups
  -GAM should do a better job of always printing out full email address instead of just username. If you see GAM reporting only the username and not the full email address, please report it as a bug.
  -All OAuth scopes are now selected by default.

GAM 2.1.1

  -Fix to prevent unnecessary call to Groups Provisioning API when viewing detailed group settings
  -should be show_in_group_directory not show_in_groups_directory.

GAM 2.1

  -New Reporting API Support allows you to pull 5 different daily reports: accounts, activity, disk_space, email_clients and summary.
  -Fix for Adding calendars to a user's list of calendars. Bug in 2.0 meant calendar was always added to the calendar list of the admin who authorized GAM, not the target user.
  -GAM now looks for an environment variable called OAUTHFILE. If it exists, GAM will use that file instead of oauth.txt for authentication. This allows admins of many Google Apps domains to switch quickly between domains.
  -Fixes for many "gam print users" issues. Thanks to Craig Box for the patch.

GAM 2.0

-Group Settings commands allow you to update Google Group settings
-Calendar commands allow you to grant access to calendars and modify user's list of calendars
-Update Admin Settings like the logo, outbound gateway, email migration and more
-OAuth is now the default authentication method. Support for username/password ClientLogin has been removed.
-Vacation/Away messages can now have a start and end date. They can also be limited to within the domain only.
-Further work to make all GAM commands multi-domain friendly.
-Lot's more bugfixes! look at the Wiki pages for details

GAM 1.9.1

-"gam print postini" will print all of the Postini Batch commands necessary to "mirror" Google Apps email addresses
  into a Postini standalone instance.

-"gam version" will print details about the version of GAM you are using.

GAM 1.9 - "Baby Steps"

GAM 1.9 is dedicated to David, my 13 month year old son. Whose just starting to step out into the world this week.

-whatnew.txt is new (is that an oxymoron?)

-Share or Hide users profile from autocomplete and contacts search.
  "gam user jsmith show profile"
  "gam user jsmith profile share"
  "gam group asked-to-be-hidden profile unshare"
  
  Profile modifications only work with OAuth, not ClientLogin (username/password entered into GAM). 
  Since the profile API uses a scope GAM was not previously making use of, you'll need to re-run
  "gam oauth request" to include the Profile API scope.

-Numerous actions can now be performed for all users in a given Organizational
  Unit just like they can be for a group or all users. i.e. "gam ou Students webclips off".

-Provisioning API OAuth scope has been subdivided into user, group, alias and ou scopes
  offering finer granularity.

-"gam all users" will now include all users across primary and secondary domains instead of just primary domain users.

-"gam info user" will show all email aliases for a user, not just those in the primary domain.

-"gam print users" with any extra arguments would fail, this should be fixed now.

-"gam info group" and "gam print groups" should no longer fail for groups with custom permissions.

GAM 1.8

-OAuth Support - GAM now supports OAuth Authentication. Instead of providing GAM your username and password, you grant GAM access to selected APIs from within your Google Account. This has a number of advantages:
  -With OAuth GAM doesn't need to know your password.
  -OAuth tokens don't expire, once you grant GAM OAuth access, GAM will have access until you revoke it within your Google account.
  -OAuth has the concept of scopes, limiting the areas and services that access is granted to. This allows you to only provide GAM with the privileges it needs.
  -More info about OAuth support is on it's way. But for now, you can try OAuth access by running "gam oauth request".

-The settings filter command http://code.google.com/p/google-apps-manager/wiki/ExamplesEmailSettings#Create_a_Filter now has more actions including forward, star, trash and never send to spam.

-Downloading Audit Exports now has partial resume support. GAM will not re-download files that already exist on the local drive. If a large export download fails you should delete the last file GAM was working on since it's incomplete and then restart the process, GAM will pick up with the last file.
